My goal is to make the SMS Buttons at the top of the site send a predetermined message to a predetermined number with a simple click. If you have any experience with rails and sms, I would really like to get your input.

I am currently working with Twilio to integrate the SMS, but would be open to any solution to make this work.


The original scaffold for this application was created by [App Scrolls](http://appscrolls.org).

The project was created with the following scrolls:

* rails_basics
* twitter_bootstrap
* simple_form
